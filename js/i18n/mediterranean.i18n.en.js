		about:"<p>The <strong>Mediterranean diet</strong> is a modern nutritional recommendation inspired by the traditional dietary patterns of Greece, southern Italy, and Spain.</p> \
        <center><p><img src='images/pyramid-mediterranean-en.png' width='240' height='270'></p></center> \
        <p>The principal aspects of this diet include proportionally high consumption of olive oil, legumes, unrefined cereals, fruits, and vegetables, moderate to high consumption of fish, moderate consumption of dairy products (mostly as cheese and yogurt), moderate wine consumption, and low consumption of meat and meat products.</p> \
        <p>Although it was first publicized in 1945 by the American doctor Ancel Keys stationed in Pioppi, Italy, the Mediterranean diet failed to gain widespread recognition until the 1990s. Objective data showing that Mediterranean diet is healthy, first originated from the Seven Countries Study.</p> \
        <p>Mediterranean diet is based on what from the point of view of mainstream nutrition is considered a paradox: that although the people living in Mediterranean countries tend to consume relatively high amounts of fat, they have far lower rates of cardiovascular disease than in countries like the United States, where similar levels of fat consumption are found.</p>",
